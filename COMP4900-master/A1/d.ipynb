        "The word \"pizza\" first appeared in a Latin text from the central Italian town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze (\"twelve pizzas\") every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday.[4][11]\n",

        "    Byzantine Greek and Late Latin pitta > pizza, cf. Modern Greek pitta bread and the Apulia and Calabrian (then Byzantine Italy) pitta,[12] a round flat bread baked in the oven at high temperature sometimes with toppings. The word pitta can in turn be traced to either Ancient Greek πικτή (pikte), \"fermented pastry\", which in Latin became \"picta\", or Ancient Greek πίσσα (pissa, Attic πίττα, pitta), \"pitch\",[13][14] or πήτεα (pḗtea), \"bran\" (πητίτης pētítēs, \"bran bread\").[15]\n",
        "    The Etymological Dictionary of the Italian Language explains it as coming from dialectal pinza \"clamp\", as in modern Italian pinze \"pliers, pincers, tongs, forceps\". Their origin is from Latin pinsere \"to pound, stamp\".[16]\n",

        "Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age.[18] Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of Achaemenid Empire during the rule King Darius I baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields[19][20] and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese.[21][22] An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the \"tables\" prophesied by Celaeno.[23]\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.[24] Prior to that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims.[24] Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries.\n",

        "A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag — red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen,[25] although later research cast doubt on this legend.[26] An official letter of recognition from the Queen's \"head of service\" remains on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.[27]\n",

        "In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in the case of more expensive restaurants, a wood or coal-fired brick oven. On deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum). Prior to use, a peel may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it.[31] When made at home, it can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly in a metal oven results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it.[32] Aficionado home-chefs sometimes use a specialty wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. Dome-shaped pizza ovens have been used for centuries,[33] which is one way to achieve true heat distribution in a wood-fired pizza oven. Another option is grilled pizza, in which the crust is baked directly on a barbecue grill. Greek pizza, like Chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.\n",

        "When it comes to preparation, the dough and ingredients can be combined on any kind of table. With mass production of pizza, the process can be completely automated. Most restaurants still use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables.

Less expensive processed cheeses or cheese analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins, and other changes in manufacture. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was 1 million metric tons (1,100,000 short tons) in the U.S. and 100,000 metric tons (110,000 short tons) in Europe.[39]\n",

Distinct regional types developed in the 20th century, including Buffalo,[52] California, Chicago, Detroit, Greek, New Haven, New York, and St. Louis styles.[53] These regional variations include deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, rolled, and pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless combinations of sauce and toppings.\n",

The traditional style of grilled pizza employed at Al Forno restaurant uses a dough coated with olive oil,[57] strained tomato sauce, thin slices of fresh mozzarella, and a garnish made from shaved scallions, and is served uncut.[59] The final product can be likened to flatbread with pizza toppings.[57] Another Providence establishment, Bob & Timmy's Grilled Pizza, was featured in a Providence-themed episode of the Travel Channel's Man v.

        "Health concerns\n",
        "\n",
        "Some mass-produced pizzas by fast food chains have been criticized as having an unhealthy balance of ingredients. Pizza can be high in salt, fat, and food energy. The USDA reports an average sodium content of 5,101 mg per 36 cm (14 in) pizza in fast food chains.[72] There are concerns about negative health effects.[73] Food chains have come under criticism at various times for the high salt content of some of their meals.[74]\n",
        "\n",
        "Frequent pizza eaters in Italy have been found to have a relatively low incidence of cardiovascular disease[75] and digestive tract cancers[76] relative to infrequent pizza eaters, although the nature of the association between pizza and such perceived benefits is unclear. Pizza consumption in Italy might only indicate adherence to traditional Mediterranean dietary patterns, which have been shown to have various health benefits.[76]\n",
        "\n",
        "Some attribute the apparent health benefits of pizza to the lycopene content in pizza sauce,[77] which research indicates likely plays a role in protecting against cardiovascular disease and various cancers.[78]\n",

        "    Calzone and stromboli are similar dishes that are often made of pizza dough folded (calzone) or rolled (stromboli) around a filling.\n",
        "    Panzerotti are similar to calzones, but fried rather than baked.\n",
        "    \"Farinata\" or \"cecina\".[83] A Ligurian (farinata) and Tuscan (cecina) regional dish made from chickpea flour, water, salt, and olive oil. Also called socca in the Provence region of France. Often baked in a brick oven, and typically weighed and sold by the slice.\n",
        "    The Alsatian Flammekueche[84] (Standard German: Flammkuchen, French: Tarte flambée) is a thin disc of dough covered in crème fraîche, onions, and bacon.\n",

        "    Pizza bagel is a bagel with toppings similar to that of traditional pizzas.\n",
        "    Pizza bread is a type of sandwich that is often served open-faced which consists of bread, tomato sauce, cheese,[86] and various toppings. Homemade versions may be prepared.\n",
        "    Pizza sticks may be prepared with pizza dough and pizza ingredients, in which the dough is shaped into stick forms, sauce and toppings are added, and it is then baked.[87] Bread dough may also be used in their preparation,[88] and some versions are fried.[89]\n",
        "    Pizza Rolls are a trade-marked commercial product.\n",
        "    Okonomiyaki, a Japanese dish cooked on a hotplate, is often referred to as \"Japanese pizza\".[90]\n",
        "    \"Zanzibar pizza\" is a street food served in Stone Town, Zanzibar, Tanzania. It uses a dough much thinner than pizza dough, almost like filo dough, filled with minced beef, onions, and an egg, similar to Moroccan bestila.[91]\n",
